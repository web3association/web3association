# January 2025

**Contribution duration** - Full month

## Overview

* Income approaches update - The wealth tax was added into the approaches analysis
* Transaction fee approaches update - Simplified the document to only consider fixed fees, finality fees and demand fees. Percentage based transaction fees are no longer necessary due to the opportunity to use a network coin tax.
* Wealth tax approaches - Considerations are made about how a wealth tax could be implemented including its coverage, regularity and the amount.
* Money resources - Actively working on the first version of some money resources for the Web3 economy website.
